# Research-Statement

My research covers two areas of macroeconomic theory. Firstly, my research seeks to develop computational and mathematical foundations for heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models. Secondly, my research seeks to understand the relationship between technological change and growth.  I am also interested in applying machine learning techniques to help solve heterogeneous agent models on the computer and understanding the impact of artificial intelligence technologies on growth.
